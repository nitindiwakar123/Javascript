//JavaScript Variables
//x = 7 Undeclared Variable 

const x = 64; // const is used for declare a constant variable
const y = 60;
let z = x + y; // let is more prefered keyword than var for declaring variables
//var z = 67  var is not prefer for declaring variables
console.log(z);

let name = "nitin", age = 18, course = "BCA"; //you can declare and define multiple variables of same keyword in one line
console.table([name, age, course]);

let car; //variable without value have value undefined

// let a; //this is not allow

// var vs let

var variable = 9;
var variable = 10; //var can be update and redeclared, var is global  scope
console.log(variable);

let n = 90;
//let n = 29; // this will throw an error beacause let can be upadated but not re-declared in the same scope, let is block scope
n = 29; //this will not thrown an error becuase let can be updated 
console.log(n);
{
    let n = 60 //this will not thrown an error beacuase let is block scoped, it is cosidered as a new variable in this block it can not be accessed outside this block
    console.log(n);
}


//let's discuss about const

//const constant; this will thrown an error beacause const must be assigned 
const constant = 87;
//const constant =  67; this will thrown an error const cannot be redeclared and cannot be updated in same scope
//constant =  89 // this will also thrown an error beacause const cannot be upadated
